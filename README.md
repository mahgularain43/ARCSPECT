# 🏠 ARCSPECT – AI-Powered Text-to-3D Home Design

ARCSPECT automates the **architectural design process** by allowing anyone to create **2D floorplans and 3D house models directly from text inputs**.  
By combining **AI, NLP, and 3D rendering**, ARCSPECT reduces the gap between **professionals and the general public**, making home design accessible without requiring advanced technical skills.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Traditional design tools like AutoCAD or Revit require **specialized training** and **manual workflows**.  
Non-professionals face challenges due to:
- Complex workflows and steep learning curves  
- Reliance on static templates or heavy manual input  
- Lack of real-time interactivity and customization  

---

## 💡 Our Solution
ARCSPECT transforms **natural language descriptions** into precise, interactive **2D layouts** and **3D models**.

✅ Accepts plain-text room descriptions  
✅ Generates accurate **2D floorplans** with dimensions & labels  
✅ Adds **textures & materials** interactively  
✅ Builds **real-time 3D visualizations** with React & Three.js  
✅ Powered by **deep learning models** for scene graph understanding & layout prediction
